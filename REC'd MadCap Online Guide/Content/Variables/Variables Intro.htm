        <p>Variables are small phrases or words that are used repeatedly throughout a document. This can include phone numbers, addresses, product names, company names, and authors. In order to have a variable, you need to create a variable set, in the form of a folder, to keep them in. Flare templates come with an existing variable set called <span class="span_1">General</span> which includes several commonly used variables. </p>
